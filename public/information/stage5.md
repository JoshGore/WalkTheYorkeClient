One of the shortest sections of Walk The Yorke, Port Vincent to Stansbury is just under 18 kilometres in length, and allows you to experience all 4 different trail types; walking, cycling, beach walks, and shared walking/cycling.

Port Vincent is a favourite holiday playground, and a popular destination for yachties.  It also has a strong community spirit with a dedicated Tidy Towns group who have been instrumental in creating some of the existing town walking trails. For this section of Walk The Yorke, start from Port Vincent, and follow the Ralph Munro Walking Trail heading south from the township.

After following the signage along the Port Vincent back beach, walkers will continue south along the clifftop, while cyclists are taken along the highway before heading towards the coast again to join up with the trail near Devils Gully Shelter.

From here, itâ€™s a shared walk/bike trail heading south, before splitting once again with the cyclists back to the highway, and walkers following a beach trail around the cliff face.

At Beach Hut, Walk The Yorke once again becomes a shared trail continuing south towards and then into Stansbury.

Originally known as Oyster Bay, Stansbury is still a producer of oysters and the oyster farms can be seen out in the bay.  Visit one of the oyster farms (on land) to purchase local oysters or learn more about them on a tour.

When following the trail into Stansbury, you will join up with the 3 existing town trails, commencing at Mills Gully, along the foreshore, and then south to Pitts Cutting.
