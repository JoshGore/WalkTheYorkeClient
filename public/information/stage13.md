Heading towards the north from Point Turton, this section of the Walk The Yorke trail can be broken down into the 5 smaller trails listed below.

In the first part of this section a beach walk takes walkers along firm beaches with rock outcrops, while cyclist following the road network to Hardwicke Bay.  Just north of Point Turton, walkers will come across Flaherty’s Beach which is the base for a popular annual event.  The Flaherty’s Beach Golf Classic is held every summer and played on the sand, with many locals and visitors taking part.  It’s worth a look, and cyclists can head towards the coast before re-joining the trail.

Heading further north, Hardwicke Bay is a fantastic small coastal town, and the tractors lined up on the beach are always a sight to behold.  With no concrete boat ramp here, the best option is to use a tractor to launch your boat and the colourful line-up of tractors is a Hardwicke Bay tradition.

The trail continues north, and varies between a shared trail, beach walk and bike track; before splitting at Parsons Beach with walkers following the coastline, and cyclists along the roads.

Bluff Beach retains some important Yorke Peninsula maritime history, with boat hoists that were used by local fishermen to hoist their boat out of the water in bad weather.  There are 2 boat hoists remaining following a storm in 1954, but there were 6 erected back in 1925.

From Barkers Rocks, keep heading north along the shared walking/cycling trail until you reach Port Rickaby. 

Port Rickaby’s Jetty was built in 1879, with a length of 121.9m (400 feet) and a low-water depth of 3.3m; this meant that cargo could be loaded directly onto the international sailing ships, instead of being ferried by ketches.
