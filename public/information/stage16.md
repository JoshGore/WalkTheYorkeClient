Following the shared trail north from Balgowan, cyclists & walkers head past Tiparra Rocks, The Bamboos and on to The Gap in the first part of this section of Walk The Yorke.  There are several camping spots along this stretch of coastline, and it is a great spot to get away from it all.

For walkers, itâ€™s a beach walk the rest of the way. Walkers follow the coastline to Cape Elizabeth and around the point, before heading north to Port Hughes and beyond to Moonta Bay.
