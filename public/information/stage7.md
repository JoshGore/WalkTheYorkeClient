Starting from the Edithburgh Jetty, you can see Troubridge Island towards the south-east.  The Troubridge Island lighthouse is now retired, but was built in 1856 and was the only pre-fabricated cast iron lighthouse in South Australia.

Troubridge Island is a recognised Conservation Park, and you can also rent the whole island, staying the in the lighthouse keeper’s cottage. With only one booking at a time, you will have it all to yourself…apart from the Little Penguins that call the island home, the thousands of migratory birds that visit each year, and the dolphins frolicking nearby.  Why not take a break from Walk The Yorke and book a stay with Troubridge Island Hideaway (phone 8852 6290).

Follow the shared walk/bike Mosaic Trail from Edithburgh to Sultana Point, a distance of 3.4km (51 minutes).  This arty trail was the brainchild of a local artist Trudie Howith, and with assistance from other local artists & community members, rocks along the trail were  mosaicked in a nautical theme.

The next section of the walk takes you to Port Moorowie, which is 27.3km from Sultana Point along the rugged Yorke Peninsula coastline.   

From Sultana Point, followed the shared trail westward around the ‘heel’ of the peninsula.  Just near you, you will see the 55 large wind turbines that make up the Wattle Point Wind Farm, which have covered the 17.5km area since 2005 harvesting the natural resource of the wind that buffets Yorke Peninsula’s southern coastline.

The trail briefly splits, with the walking trail following the coastline and the cycling trail just a little further inland along the road; before coming back together as a shared trail.  Have a rest at the Wattle Point Shelter, or go on a little further to camp for a night or 2 at either the Sheoak Beach or Goldsmith Beach camp spots (camping permits required)

Continuing on from Goldsmith’s Beach, the shared trail heads towards the Troubridge Hill Lighthouse.  It’s worth a visit to the lighthouse to view its unique design up close.  Measuring 32 metres high, Troubridge Hill Lighthouse has a light range of 22 nautical miles and operates off mains electricity with a backup generator.  This unusual lighthouse is built with custom-made special wedge shaped clay bricks, and it is designed to be resistant to high winds and earthquakes, as in the early 1900's the area experienced numerous earthquakes.

Following the trail, it will again split into a walking trail and a cycling trail, and you will come to another camping spot, Kemp Bay and the trail’s Kemp Bay Shelter.

From here, the trail continues as a shared walk/bike trail into Port Moorowie.
