The Port Victoria to Balgowan section of Walk The Yorke is one of the shorter sections at a distance of 21.3 kilometres, and taking 5 hours 20 minutes.

Known as the ‘last of the windjammer ports’, Port Victoria was a hive of activity in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s with the shipping grain overseas via Cape Horn.  Port Victoria was the last port in Australia to load a windjammer, which earnt the town it’s nickname; there is a memorial near the town jetty to commemorate its maritime heritage.

Port Victoria was where the Great Grain Races began, where in 1932 twenty ships loaded with wheat left Port Victoria bound for the English Channel (a distance of 24,139 kilometres).  The ‘Parma’ won the race in 1932, completing the voyage in 83 days.

Off the coastline of Port Victoria is Wardang Island, which is 8.4 x 2.4 kilometres and covers an area of around 2,025 hectares.

From Port Victoria through to Balgowan, the entire section of Walk The Yorke has a shared trail for walkers & cyclists.

Just to the north of Port Victoria, the trail goes inland through the Nharangga Aboriginal Lands and Point Pearce.  This area is culturally significant for Yorke Peninsula, with a wealth of history.  It is also home to the Southern Hairy-nose Wombat, and their warrens can be seen throughout.

The shared walking/cycling trail continues north to Balgowan, once a shipping port and now a coastal holiday retreat.
