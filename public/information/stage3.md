One of the shorter walks on Walk The Yorke, start at the Ardrossan Jetty and follow the signs south out of town towards the highway, and then on to Pine Point.

You can walk the full 18.8km from Ardrossan to Pine Point (one-way), or choose to do one of the smaller walks that makes up this section - Ardrossan to James Well 8.1km (2 hours), James Well to Rogues Point 1.6km (25 mins) and Rogues Point to Pine Point 9.1km (2 hours 17 mins).

Just on the southern edge of Ardrossan, you will pass the loading jetty and mining operations.  Ardrossan is a hub of industry, with salt from Price shipped from the jetty; and the Viterra silos and bunkers a depot for local farmers reaping crops at harvest (grain isn’t shipped from here, but transported by road train south to Port Giles). 

The Arrium mine extracts dolomite, which is shipped out to other ports.  One of the best views over Ardrossan & Gulf St Vincent can be found at the Arrium Lookout, just near the mine operations; don’t miss this birds-eye view and a great photo opportunity.

After getting that perfect photo, continue south and turn left onto Parara Road towards the coast.  Parara is the Aboriginal word for ‘middle’, and this area was home to the Parara Homestead owned by the Bowmans, who were pioneers in farming & sheep grazing across the state and went on to have the township of Bowmans in the Mid-North named after them and built Martindale Hall, near Clare.

Parara Beach is a popular crabbing beach, with many venturing out with their crab rakes in the warmer months (September to April) to gather Blue Swimmer crabs.  In December 2014, it was also the location of the extraordinary and significant marine event, where 7 Sperm Whales were found stranded after beaching themselves at low tide.  A memorial on the coast at Parara Beach honours this event, which was the first of its kind in over 200 years in South Australian history.

Head south along the coastline and join up with the James Well/Rogues Point Trail that goes to Pine Point. 

James Well & Rogues Point are small settlements that offer fantastic crabbing, fishing & watersports.  There are self-contained holiday houses available in both towns.

Head further south along the designated trail, and as you pass the cliffs just north of Pine Point, you will notice a white clay material, rich in Kaolin, which is used for making porcelain and bone china.  Although considered, the clay deposits (estimated to be more than 66,000 tonnes) were never extracted.
