# Stage 2: Port Clinton to Ardrossan
Starting from Port Clinton, follow the Walk The Yorke signs south out of town and towards Price.

The Port Clinton to Ardrossan section of Walk The Yorke is designed to be walked as one section (27.8km), but can be walked in 2 sections  The 2 sections are Port Clinton to Price 7.8km (1 hour 57 mins), and Price to Ardrossan 20km (5 hours).

The Samphire Coast continues down the western side of Gulf St Vincent (eastern coastline of Yorke Peninsula) to Ardrossan, with many mangrove habitats found along the way.

Wills Creek Conservation Park at Price is a popular spot for visitors, and can be accessed from the causeway from the township, along with the boat ramp.

Price is also a location for one of Yorke Peninsula’s key mining industries, salt.  Cheetham Salt uses a solar process for harvesting salt, and the huge salt pans can be seen alongside the township and as you cross the causeway to Wills Creek.  Cheetham Salt provides Saxa table salt and pool salt, and was once the largest salt refinery in the Southern Hemisphere producing over 1000 tonnes per week.

Continue heading south from Price, and join up with the CH Smith Trail at Tiddy Widdy Beach.  Continue along this coastal trail before arriving at Ardrossan.

There are plenty of accommodation options in Ardrossan, including caravan parks, motel & hotel units, and self-contained holiday houses.   You can choose to spend the night or a few days, and don’t forget to try your hand at catching Blue Swimmer crabs; best in the months with an ‘r’ when the waters are warmer.

While in Ardrossan, don’t forget to visit the Ardrossan Museum, home of the Stump Jump Plough, invented by local farmers in 1876.  The Ardrossan Museum is the former factory of the plough, and has a wealth of history.
