From Port Rickaby heading north towards Port Victoria, walkers follow a beach walk for almost the entire section of 21.6 kilometres, while cyclists follow the roads, before joining up on a shared trail just south of the Port Victoria township.

The Walk The Yorke trail is most definitely about the beach throughout this section.  Long wide beaches with shallow, crystal blue waters can be found as far as the eye can see.  There are also dune systems all along the coastline, which have coastal vegetation to help protect them.

This part of Walk The Yorke goes along Wauraltee Beach, where you can camp the night or a few days.  There is also the Wauraltee Beach Shelter if you just want to take a rest from your walk.

Walk The Yorke continues north before meeting up with the cycling trail, before going past Rifle Butts Beach & South Beach, just before Port Victoria.  The shared trail follows the coastline into Port Victoria; past the golf course, jetty and maritime museum.
