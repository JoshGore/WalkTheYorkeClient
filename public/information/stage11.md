Walkers start this section of Walk The Yorke from Gleesons Landing, before travelling the 20.5 kilometres (4 hours 58 minutes) to Corny Point around Yorke Peninsula’s toe. 

You can camp overnight at Gleesons Landing (permit required) before starting your trek, or just choose to walk one of the 3 smaller walks listed below.

The trail for walkers alternates between a walking trail and beach walk throughout this section, but it means a variety of experiences…from small beaches with soft sands to coastline pounded by the Southern ocean.

For cyclists, some of this section is inaccessible and because of this the bike trail doesn’t begin at Gleeson’s Landing, but instead follows established rural roads with local names, West Coast Road, Gleeson’s Road, Marion Bay Road and Point Annie Road, before joining up with the walking trail at Point Annie.

Some of the best surfing beaches in South Australia can be found along this section of Yorke Peninsula’s coastline, and you might be lucky enough to see some talented local surfers in action.  Or perhaps even dolphins catching a wave?

From Point Annie, the walking and cycling trails run parallel along the coastline and past the Corny Point Lighthouse.

Continue in an easterly direction into the Corny Point township, where you can choose to spend the night in a holiday house or at the caravan park; or grab a drink at the tavern or general store before heading on to the next park of the trail.
