Providing some spectacular views over Gulf St Vincent, the Pine Point to Port Vincent section has some of the most varied trail types on Walk The Yorke.  There are 4 different trail types; walking, cycling, beach walks, and shared walking/cycling.

Heading south from Pine Point, walkers & cyclists share the same path until the turn off the Black Point.   From here, cyclists continue along the highway to Port Julia, while walkers following the coastline, first along the designated trail then along a beach walk.

For walkers who follow the trail to Black Point  and for cyclists who detour before join back up with the bike trail along the highway  Black Point has some amazing history for such a small place.

Once a 19th century quarantine station, Black Point is now one of the most prized pieces of real estate in South Australia.  With around 150 ‘shacks’ lining the beachfront, or Millionaire’s Row, and a plentiful crabbing ground on the doorstep, Black Point has certainly turned it’s fortunes around in the last 200 years.

The walking trail curves along the beachfront of Black Point, and along the roadside behind the shacks, before heading south once at the point.  From here it becomes a beach walk until you get to Port Julia.

Cyclists follow the St Vincent Highway, before taking the first turn off to the left towards Port Julia and the coast.  Port Julia was once a busy port with wheat and barley being loaded onto ketches bound for Port Adelaide. Today, the jetty and cargo shed (known as the ‘Red Shed’ remain as a reminder of the town’s maritime history.

From Port Julia, Walk The Yorke continues south towards Port Vincent, with the trail shared between walkers & cyclists.  Not too far from Port Julia, you’ll come across ‘The Dipper’, a favourite with Yorkes locals for it’s shacks and secluded location.

Heading further towards Port Vincent is Sheoak Flat, before the walk continues along the cliffside with amazing views not normally seen on a drive to Yorke Peninsula.  It’s worth getting out of the car for!

As you get closer to Port Vincent, you’ll pass the Port Vincent Golf Course and be sure to stop at the Port Vincent Marina Lookout soon after.  It’s got some great views over the marina, bay and Port Vincent township.
