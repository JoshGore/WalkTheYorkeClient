Start this section of Walk The Yorke at Corny Point, before heading east to The Pines which takes 2 hours 44 minutes to cover a distance of 10.6 kilometres.  Walkers follow the beach all the way to The Pines, while cyclists use the road.

After The Pines, the beach walk continues for walkers to Point Souttar, past Leven Beach Conservation Park and Burners Beach (9.8km, 2 hours 27 minutes).  The cycling trail once again follows the road, before meeting up with the walking trail at the Burners Beach Shelter.

From the Burners Beach Shelter, walkers & cyclists follow the shared trail to Point Turton.  On the way, it passes a spot to the west of Point Turton, known as ‘The Drain’.  This was a channel dug in 1900 by around 20 men to drain a big swamp area, and took around 50 weeks to complete.  ’The Drain’ comes out into the sea near a place called Chinaman’s Camp, where Chinese workers used to catch and cure fish.

The last part of this section, from Point Souttar to Point Turton Jetty is 11km and takes 2 hours 45 minutes.  Just near the jetty, you will see the Point Turton Caravan Park, which is built on the old limestone quarry.  Limestone was extracted from the quarry between 1906 and 1919 and sent to Port Pirie, where it was used as flux at the smelters.
