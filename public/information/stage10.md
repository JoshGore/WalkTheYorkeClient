Marion Bay is a small coastal township, said to be named after the steamer ‘Marion’ which was shipwrecked there in 1862.  This section of Walk The Yorke starts at the Marion Bay Jetty, and is one of the longest, taking over 13 hours and covering a distance of more than 53 kilometres.

From Marion Bay, cyclists & walkers travel along the shared trail in a south-westerly direction towards Stenhouse Bay.  The trail will take you through the entrance to Innes National Park and past the Natural Resources Centre (walkers & cyclists are excempt from entrance fees).

Stenhouse Bay Jetty is worth a stop before continuing on through the park on the designated trail. The jetty was once used for the exporting of gypsum, which was mined in the Inneston village within the National Park.  Today the jetty is popular for fishing, and provides a great photo opportunity.

Just up from the jetty is another spot worth a visit.  A Vietnamese seaman, Dao Thanh was buried on the clifftop overlooking the jetty in 1940, after he broke his neck in an accident upon a ship that was collecting gypsum bound for Noumea.  Unsure how to deal with a death at sea, it was decided to bury Dao Thanh in a Buddhist ceremony at Stenhouse Bay, however the grave remained unmarked until 1997 when the Vietnamese community erected a memorial plaque on the grave.

Within Innes National Park, walkers & cyclists follow 2 different trails, so please take note of the signage and directions.

Some of the experiences in Innes National Park are off the Walk The Yorke trail, including Cape Spencer Lighthouse and West Cape.  They are worth a visit, but please remember that Innes National Park has roaming wildlife and to be mindful of the vehicles in the park.

There are camping opportunities within the park  but if you plan to stay the night, please book ahead to avoid being disappointed.  If you don’t feel like camping, Inneston has self-contained accommodation available.

Continue to follow the Walk The Yorke trail through Innes National Park  from Pondalowie Bay it’s a shared trail for walkers & cyclists  and stop in at Shell Beach, Browns Beach and Gym Beach along the way.

At Gym Beach, and where Walk The Yorke leaves Innes National Park, the trail splits once again with walkers following the coastline on walking trails & beach walks, and cyclists a little further inland along the established roads.

The Southern coastline, from Gym Beach to Daly Head provide some of South Australia’s best surfing, with popular spots including Baby Lizards and Formby Bay.   Daly Head has been recognised as a National Surfing Reserve and is worth a visit; plus, provides yet another photo opportunity.
